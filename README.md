## Overview of the project

### Project:Student Grade Tracker
### Objective:
To develop a comprehensive Java application for effectively managing and tracking student grades. The application should facilitate:
 * Data Entry: Seamless input and storage of student information (names, IDs, etc.) and their grades for various subjects or assessments.
 * Grade Calculation: Accurate calculation of grades, including averages, weighted averages, and grade point averages (GPAs).
 * Data Reporting: Generation of various reports, such as individual student reports, class summaries, and honor roll lists.
 * Data Analysis: Provide basic analytical tools for identifying trends, areas of improvement, and potential academic concerns.
### Key Activities:
 * Data Model Design: Define a robust data structure (e.g., using classes or objects) to represent student information and their associated grades.
 * User Interface Development: Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for:
   * Data entry and editing.
   * Grade calculation and reporting.
   * Data visualization and analysis.
 * Data Storage and Retrieval: Implement efficient mechanisms for storing and retrieving student data (e.g., using databases or files).
 * Calculation and Reporting Logic: Develop algorithms for accurate grade calculations and generate comprehensive reports in various formats (e.g., tables, charts).
 * Error Handling and Validation: Incorporate robust error handling to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid inputs.
### Technology Stack:
 * Primary Language: Java will be employed for the development of the entire application.
 * Data Structures: Utilize appropriate data structures (e.g., arrays, lists, maps) to efficiently store and manage student data.
 * Optional: Consider incorporating a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) for more advanced data management and persistence.
